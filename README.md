Project2 for Dynamic Web Applications (Spring 2017)


Basic PHP form handling. First time working with classes/objects.  Implemented two of my very own classes!
* get_formvalues: can get/set variables from either POST or GET via getsetvalues function
* TipCalculate: returns bill split rounded (splitRounded function) or as float (split function)
